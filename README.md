# Javascript Koans Pro

## Working

To start working w/ the katas on the browser you can install the dependencies by doping

    npm install

And then launch the koans page in the browser by doing

    grunt serve

If you have the [livereload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) plugin in the browser, every time you change a `.js` file, the page in the browser will be updated automatically

## Notes from the original author

> If you like JavaScript Koans you might enjoy my newer, more user friendly, project [Didacto: JavaScript](http://javascript.didacto.net/)

JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file jskoans.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

The koans use the [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test syntax and test runner.
